# Pushups365!

This project was inspired by my nephew who encouraged me to do one pushup per day, adding one each day...  January 1=1, January 31=31, etc...

### Demo

[Try a live demo](https://apps.shearer-consulting.com/pushups365/)


### Using the app

1. Run the app (or, better yet, add to homescreen on your mobile device)
2. Add reps in increments of 1 or 10 until you hit the auto-calculated daily target
3. At the end of the day the progress resets back to 0

### Seems kinda simple

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is basically a "hello world" application for me to play with React.js.  Expect it to change...frequently...and sometimes with poor or sloppy syntax as I find the edges of React.js.

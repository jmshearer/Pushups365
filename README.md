# ðŸ’ª Pushups365

This project was inspired by my nephew who encouraged me to do one pushup per day, adding one each day: January 1 = ðŸ’ªx1, January 31 = ðŸ’ªx31, ... December 31 = ðŸ’ªx365.  Not too bad for the first few weeks but, as you start breaking it up into sets throughout the day, keeping track becomes cumbersome.  Hence, Pushups365 (or, you know, just working out more so 365 reps per set is doable...) 

### Demo

### Using the app

1. Run the app or add to your device's home screen for easy access.
2. Add reps in increments of 1 or 10 until you hit the auto-calculated daily target.
3. The target will increment and the progress will reset to 0 after midnight.

### Seems kinda simple

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is effectively a "hello world" application for me to play with React.js.  Expect it to change...frequently...and sometimes with poor or sloppy syntax as I find the edges of React.js.

### Why the 80's video game vibe?
Why not?
